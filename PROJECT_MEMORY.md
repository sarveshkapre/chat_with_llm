- Template: YYYY-MM-DD | Decision | Why | Evidence (tests/logs) | Commit | Confidence (high/medium/low) | Trust (trusted/untrusted)
- 2026-02-11 | Prioritize Global Cycle 12 saved-search reliability/parity hardening (roundtrip smoke scenario + tie-order parity + saved-card verbatim visibility) over broader roadmap expansion | Owner/bot issues are still empty and CI is green; highest-impact pending risk in current Signal Search focus was unverified saved-search rerun persistence plus potential top-k/full-sort divergence under equal-score timestamp-fallback datasets | Owner issue/CI scans (`gh issue list --state open --limit 100 --json number,title,author,url,createdAt`, `gh run list --limit 30 --json databaseId,displayTitle,workflowName,headSha,status,conclusion,url,createdAt,event,headBranch`) and bounded market scan sources (`https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10056348-how-do-i-search-my-chat-history-in-chatgpt`, `https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11487644-search-in-chatgpt`, `https://www.perplexity.ai/help-center/en/articles/10354775-technical-capabilities-of-threads`, `https://www.perplexity.ai/help-center/en/articles/10352961-what-are-spaces`, `https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/filtering-results.html`) | TBD | medium | untrusted
- 2026-02-11 | Add `/smoke-search/saved-roundtrip` fixture route with persisted-state assertions, explicit stable tie-break ordering in Unified Search sort/top-k helpers, and saved-search `verbatim` visibility in cards | Locks a repeated backlog gap (saved-search smoke roundtrip), prevents subtle ordering drift in parity-critical export/UI comparisons, and improves preset clarity for power users with low regression risk | `npm test -- tests/unified-search-smoke-fixture.test.ts tests/unified-search.test.ts`, `npm run lint -- --max-warnings=0 && npm run check:workflows && npm test && npm run build && node scripts/smoke.mjs --provider mock --skip-build` | TBD | high | trusted

## Mistakes And Fixes
- Template: YYYY-MM-DD | Issue | Root cause | Fix | Prevention rule | Commit | Confidence
- 2026-02-11 | New saved-roundtrip smoke assertion failed despite correct behavior (`/smoke-search/saved-roundtrip controls did not preserve ...`) | Assertion expected a selected `<option value="tasks">`, but filter state is rendered as pill buttons; also assumed contiguous `verbatim:true` text while SSR output included React comment separators | Updated smoke checks to validate selected tasks pill styling and regex-match SSR verbatim markup (`verbatim:(?:<!-- -->)?true`) | For HTML smoke assertions, inspect real SSR output before finalizing selectors and avoid assumptions about React comment-node serialization | TBD | high
- 2026-02-11 | `/smoke-search` verification initially failed with fixture route `404` | First implementation used `src/app/__smoke/...`; Next.js treats underscore-prefixed app segments as private/non-routable | Moved to routable `src/app/smoke-search/page.tsx` and kept env gate (`SMOKE_ENABLE_SEARCH_FIXTURE=1`) | For App Router smoke routes, avoid underscore-prefixed segments unless intentionally private/non-routable; verify route appears in `next build` route table before asserting in smoke | f3e107b | high
- 2026-02-11 | `node scripts/smoke.mjs --provider mock --skip-build` failed after introducing diagnostics query-param logic | Using `useSearchParams` in the client search surface altered prerendered `/search` HTML expectations that smoke asserts against | Switched diagnostics-flag parsing to a window-location effect (`URLSearchParams(window.location.search)`) to preserve stable prerendered text while keeping debug behavior | For smoke-guarded static pages, avoid introducing routing hooks that can alter SSR/prerender output unless smoke assertions are updated in the same commit | d3f7396 | high
- 2026-02-11 | Initial `npm run perf:search` invocation returned `No test files found` | Harness used `npm exec vitest ...` without `--`, so flags were interpreted by npm and the perf config filter was ignored | Added `vitest.perf.config.ts` for `.bench.ts` coverage and switched runner command to `npm exec -- vitest run --config ...` | When wrapping tool CLIs with `npm exec`, always include `--` and validate filters/config handling with one dry-run before recording baselines | fbdbcbb | high
- 2026-02-11 | `node scripts/smoke.mjs --provider mock --skip-build` failed during parallel verification | Smoke start was launched before `next build` finished, so `.next` was incomplete | Re-ran smoke sequentially after build completion and kept sequential build+smoke command | Never parallelize commands with build/start dependency edges; use `npm run build && node scripts/smoke.mjs --provider mock --skip-build` | 57bf944 | high
- 2026-02-09 | Workflow policy check initially missed `- uses:` YAML step form | Regex only matched `uses:` when it started the line (ignoring list item form) | Updated matcher to accept `- uses:` and added a unit test | Add regression tests for policy rules so guardrails don't become false-negative | 0a9bbdf | high
- 2026-02-10 | `readStoredJson()` SSR guard update broke storage unit tests | Tests mocked `window` + `localStorage` but not `document` | Updated tests to define `document` for browser-mode cases | When hardening browser/SSR guards, update unit test environment shims in the same commit | 30a28ca | high
- 2026-02-10 | `npm run smoke:mock` failed with `.next/lock` | Ran `next build` in parallel with `scripts/smoke.mjs`, which also executes `next build` | Re-ran `npm run smoke:mock` sequentially after the standalone build completed | Avoid parallelizing verification commands when one command internally runs the other (build+smoke); run smoke sequentially or pass `--skip-build` | 8627eef | medium

## Known Risks
- LocalStorage is still the single source of truth; read/write guards now cover malformed payloads and basic write failures in Unified Search, but cross-tab drift and full-quota recovery UX remain risk areas until server sync exists.

## Next Prioritized Tasks
- P2: Add stale-selection smoke coverage that exercises `Prune stale` after cross-tab thread deletion simulation.
- P2: Add perf guardrail thresholds for 10k Unified Search datasets with variance-tolerant med/p95 bands.
- P2: Add shareable Unified Search URL state (`q`, `type`, `sort`, `time`, `limit`, `verbatim`) with hydration-safe defaults.
- P3: Refactor shared `signal-*` storage keys into one constants module and migrate all surfaces to it.
