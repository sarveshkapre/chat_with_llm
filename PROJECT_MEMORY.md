## Mistakes And Fixes
- Template: YYYY-MM-DD | Issue | Root cause | Fix | Prevention rule | Commit | Confidence
- 2026-02-11 | `npm run perf:search` failed after shared-fixture refactor (`checksum` remained `0`) | Generated fixture text initially lacked complete default benchmark query token coverage, so filter passes returned no visible hits | Added shared baseline token phrase across deterministic fixture text fields and reran perf + full verification | When refactoring synthetic datasets, validate default benchmark query coverage before trusting checksum/perf invariants | a8f09d4 | high
- 2026-02-11 | `node scripts/smoke.mjs --provider mock --skip-build` falsely failed archive-operator assertions | Raw HTML assertions matched non-visible thread titles serialized inside RSC `<script>` payloads | Added `stripScriptsFromHtml()` before archive include/exclude checks in smoke assertions | For SSR smoke checks, either scope to visible DOM sections or strip serialized script payloads before text presence assertions | a8f09d4 | high
- 2026-02-11 | New operator-strip regression assertion failed (`expected 'foo:bar \"literal type:threads\"'`) | The test assumed quote characters were preserved, but tokenizer normalization intentionally strips wrapping quotes while retaining token text | Updated assertion to verify semantic preservation (`foo:bar literal type:threads`) and reran targeted + full verification | For parser-strip tests, assert semantic token retention/removal, not quote-character fidelity, unless quote preservation is an explicit behavior contract | 63829c1 | high
- 2026-02-11 | New stale-selection smoke assertion failed (`did not expose expected stale-selection recovery control`) even though fixture rendered the control | Assertion used a strict plain-text regex (`Prune stale (1)`) and ignored React SSR comment separators around adjacent text nodes | Updated matcher to SSR-safe regex (`Prune stale\\s*\\((?:<!-- -->)?1(?:<!-- -->)?\\)`) and re-ran smoke after rebuild | For SSR HTML smoke checks that target adjacent text nodes, inspect rendered HTML and include React comment-node-tolerant patterns from the start | b935bf5 | high
- 2026-02-11 | New saved-roundtrip smoke assertion failed despite correct behavior (`/smoke-search/saved-roundtrip controls did not preserve ...`) | Assertion expected a selected `<option value="tasks">`, but filter state is rendered as pill buttons; also assumed contiguous `verbatim:true` text while SSR output included React comment separators | Updated smoke checks to validate selected tasks pill styling and regex-match SSR verbatim markup (`verbatim:(?:<!-- -->)?true`) | For HTML smoke assertions, inspect real SSR output before finalizing selectors and avoid assumptions about React comment-node serialization | a45d4c1 | high
- 2026-02-11 | `/smoke-search` verification initially failed with fixture route `404` | First implementation used `src/app/__smoke/...`; Next.js treats underscore-prefixed app segments as private/non-routable | Moved to routable `src/app/smoke-search/page.tsx` and kept env gate (`SMOKE_ENABLE_SEARCH_FIXTURE=1`) | For App Router smoke routes, avoid underscore-prefixed segments unless intentionally private/non-routable; verify route appears in `next build` route table before asserting in smoke | f3e107b | high
- 2026-02-11 | `node scripts/smoke.mjs --provider mock --skip-build` failed after introducing diagnostics query-param logic | Using `useSearchParams` in the client search surface altered prerendered `/search` HTML expectations that smoke asserts against | Switched diagnostics-flag parsing to a window-location effect (`URLSearchParams(window.location.search)`) to preserve stable prerendered text while keeping debug behavior | For smoke-guarded static pages, avoid introducing routing hooks that can alter SSR/prerender output unless smoke assertions are updated in the same commit | d3f7396 | high
- 2026-02-11 | Initial `npm run perf:search` invocation returned `No test files found` | Harness used `npm exec vitest ...` without `--`, so flags were interpreted by npm and the perf config filter was ignored | Added `vitest.perf.config.ts` for `.bench.ts` coverage and switched runner command to `npm exec -- vitest run --config ...` | When wrapping tool CLIs with `npm exec`, always include `--` and validate filters/config handling with one dry-run before recording baselines | fbdbcbb | high
- 2026-02-11 | `node scripts/smoke.mjs --provider mock --skip-build` failed during parallel verification | Smoke start was launched before `next build` finished, so `.next` was incomplete | Re-ran smoke sequentially after build completion and kept sequential build+smoke command | Never parallelize commands with build/start dependency edges; use `npm run build && node scripts/smoke.mjs --provider mock --skip-build` | 57bf944 | high
- 2026-02-09 | Workflow policy check initially missed `- uses:` YAML step form | Regex only matched `uses:` when it started the line (ignoring list item form) | Updated matcher to accept `- uses:` and added a unit test | Add regression tests for policy rules so guardrails don't become false-negative | 0a9bbdf | high
- 2026-02-10 | `readStoredJson()` SSR guard update broke storage unit tests | Tests mocked `window` + `localStorage` but not `document` | Updated tests to define `document` for browser-mode cases | When hardening browser/SSR guards, update unit test environment shims in the same commit | 30a28ca | high
- 2026-02-10 | `npm run smoke:mock` failed with `.next/lock` | Ran `next build` in parallel with `scripts/smoke.mjs`, which also executes `next build` | Re-ran `npm run smoke:mock` sequentially after the standalone build completed | Avoid parallelizing verification commands when one command internally runs the other (build+smoke); run smoke sequentially or pass `--skip-build` | 8627eef | medium

## Known Risks
- LocalStorage is still the single source of truth; read/write guards now cover malformed payloads and basic write failures in Unified Search, but cross-tab drift and full-quota recovery UX remain risk areas until server sync exists.

## Next Prioritized Tasks
- P2: Add compact smoke path for `/search` keyboard result navigation (`ArrowDown` + `Enter`) using Playwright.
- P2: Add CI policy check enforcing explicit pass/fail tokens for every new `PROJECT_MEMORY.md` verification entry.
- P2: Add malformed-write diagnostics panel in Library data tools for recent localStorage write failures.
- P3: Add docs examples mapping `type:`/`verbatim:` operator usage to shareable URL params.
