## Mistakes And Fixes
- Template: YYYY-MM-DD | Issue | Root cause | Fix | Prevention rule | Commit | Confidence
- 2026-02-11 | Initial `npm run perf:search` invocation returned `No test files found` | Harness used `npm exec vitest ...` without `--`, so flags were interpreted by npm and the perf config filter was ignored | Added `vitest.perf.config.ts` for `.bench.ts` coverage and switched runner command to `npm exec -- vitest run --config ...` | When wrapping tool CLIs with `npm exec`, always include `--` and validate filters/config handling with one dry-run before recording baselines | fbdbcbb | high
- 2026-02-11 | `node scripts/smoke.mjs --provider mock --skip-build` failed during parallel verification | Smoke start was launched before `next build` finished, so `.next` was incomplete | Re-ran smoke sequentially after build completion and kept sequential build+smoke command | Never parallelize commands with build/start dependency edges; use `npm run build && node scripts/smoke.mjs --provider mock --skip-build` | 57bf944 | high
- 2026-02-09 | Workflow policy check initially missed `- uses:` YAML step form | Regex only matched `uses:` when it started the line (ignoring list item form) | Updated matcher to accept `- uses:` and added a unit test | Add regression tests for policy rules so guardrails don't become false-negative | 0a9bbdf | high
- 2026-02-10 | `readStoredJson()` SSR guard update broke storage unit tests | Tests mocked `window` + `localStorage` but not `document` | Updated tests to define `document` for browser-mode cases | When hardening browser/SSR guards, update unit test environment shims in the same commit | 30a28ca | high
- 2026-02-10 | `npm run smoke:mock` failed with `.next/lock` | Ran `next build` in parallel with `scripts/smoke.mjs`, which also executes `next build` | Re-ran `npm run smoke:mock` sequentially after the standalone build completed | Avoid parallelizing verification commands when one command internally runs the other (build+smoke); run smoke sequentially or pass `--skip-build` | 8627eef | medium

## Known Risks
- LocalStorage is still the single source of truth; schema guards now prevent several malformed payload crashes in Unified Search, but quota pressure and cross-tab drift remain key risk areas until server sync exists.

## Next Prioritized Tasks
- P2: Extend smoke with fixture-backed localStorage preload so `/search` operator assertions validate non-empty filtered results.
- P2: Extract Unified Search keyboard logic into a dedicated hook (`useUnifiedSearchKeyboard`) to reduce maintenance risk in `unified-search.tsx`.
- P2: Add `/search` debug diagnostics mode (counts per type + filtered-out reasons) behind a query-param flag.
- P2: Add smoke assertion for saved-search roundtrip (save, reload, run) under mock mode.
