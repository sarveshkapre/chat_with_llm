## Insights
- 2026-02-11 bounded market scan (untrusted): baseline research/search products emphasize fast keyboard-driven retrieval and explicit query narrowing; OpenAI help docs highlight global history search, Kagi emphasizes operator-level filtering control, and Linear’s command workflow reinforces keyboard-first discovery expectations for power users. Sources: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11487644-search-in-chatgpt, https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10056348-how-do-i-search-my-chat-history-in-chatgpt, https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/filtering-results.html, https://linear.app/blog/introducing-command-k.
- 2026-02-11 bounded market scan (untrusted): baseline answer engines expose explicit search narrowing controls and searchable workspace history; clear operator semantics are table-stakes for trust. Perplexity documents thread context and Spaces organization, OpenAI documents ChatGPT history search (including keyboard-open behavior), and Kagi documents explicit query operators/time filters. Sources: https://www.perplexity.ai/help-center/en/articles/10354775-technical-capabilities-of-threads, https://www.perplexity.ai/help-center/en/articles/10352961-what-are-spaces, https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11487644-search-in-chatgpt, https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10056348-how-do-i-search-my-chat-history-in-chatgpt, https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/filtering-results.html.
- 2026-02-11 market scan (untrusted): Perplexity and ChatGPT both set baseline expectations around searchable history/workspaces and mode/source controls; Kagi highlights explicit query filtering controls (including verbatim/time constraints). This reinforces that operator semantics must be deterministic and transparent, especially in mixed-result surfaces. Sources: Perplexity thread capabilities (https://www.perplexity.ai/help-center/en/articles/10354775-technical-capabilities-of-threads), Perplexity spaces (https://www.perplexity.ai/help-center/en/articles/10352961-what-are-spaces), OpenAI help on history/search (https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10056348-how-do-i-search-my-chat-history-in-chatgpt, https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11487644-search-in-chatgpt), Kagi filtering docs (https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/filtering-results.html).
- Operator parsing that strips tokens from free text must be paired with per-type operator enforcement; otherwise unsupported operators silently widen results and degrade trust.
- Scorecard failures were not from scan results; they were caused by workflow policy validation when `publish_results: true` was combined with write-level permissions.
- Release automation can hard-fail in repos where GitHub Actions cannot open PRs; explicit gating keeps `main` green while preserving manual release capability.
- Signal Search usability improves when actions happen in the search surface itself; forcing users back into Library for pin/archive/space edits adds unnecessary friction.
- Users rely on notes and citations during follow-ups, so search must index those fields; otherwise “Signal Search” fails to find high-signal content.
- LocalStorage remains the single source of truth; until server sync exists we need light-weight resiliency features (like snippets plus filtering) to avoid data lock-in.
- Next.js static generation can execute transitive deps in SSR bundles; importing `docx` at module scope pulled in browserified Node stream polyfills that touch `localStorage` and emitted warnings. Lazy-loading large export deps keeps builds clean and reduces baseline bundle weight.
- Market scan (untrusted, links only): comparable products emphasize citations + “save/organize” workflows; keyboard shortcuts (search focus/clear) and structured filters/operators show up as baseline UX expectations.
- Sources: Perplexity (https://www.perplexity.ai) help: thread retention + recovery (https://www.perplexity.ai/help-center/en/articles/12637451-where-did-my-threads-go), thread context + web toggle constraints (https://www.perplexity.ai/help-center/en/articles/10354775-technical-capabilities-of-threads), Spaces overview (https://www.perplexity.ai/help-center/en/articles/10352961-what-are-spaces); Kagi Assistant docs (https://help.kagi.com/kagi/ai/assistant.html); Kagi filtering docs (verbatim + time windows) (https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/filtering-results.html); Obsidian Tasks Presets (saved query presets pattern) (https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Presets); OpenAI Help Center: Search in ChatGPT (https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11487644-search-in-chatgpt); OpenAI Help Center: ChatGPT history search (exact match + Cmd/Ctrl+K) (https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10056348-how-do-i-search-my-chat-history-in-chatgpt%3F.midi); OpenAI Help Center: ChatGPT data export flow (https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7260999-how-do-i-export-my-chatgpt-history-and-data).
- Gap map (untrusted, synthesized):
- Missing: accounts/auth + database-backed storage + secure sharing model; robust file ingestion (PDF/DOCX/etc) + retrieval.
- Weak: durable background jobs (research/tasks) + notifications/timezones; user-facing recovery flows for local-only data.
- Parity: citations + web toggle, multi-turn threads, exports, “save/organize” surfaces (collections/spaces).
- Differentiator: local-first unified search with in-place bulk actions and workspace templates without forcing signup.
